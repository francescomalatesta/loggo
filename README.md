# Loggo - Learning Project in Go

This is a simple learning project I am making as I am learning Go for my everyday job in Hootsuite.

Loggo is a very basic logging service with a TCP server implementation to handle requests.

Such original name, much training.

## Testing

Run tests with:

```
$ go test ./...
```
